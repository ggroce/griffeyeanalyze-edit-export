# GA_JSON_InsertRelativeFilePath
JSON editor, enabling the export of media files along with file metadata details from Griffeye Analyze.  Inserts the relativefilepath property to an exported JSON file, based on the contents of an accompanying file directory containing filenames named by their respective MD5 hash.  

Step 1: The user must export all desired media files to a single directory named "Files", with filesnames representing their MD5.  
Step 2: The user must remove any file extensions generated from step 1, (windows commandline from directory containing files: "ren * *.").  
Step 3: The user must export a JSON, selecting the same media files from step 1, exporting only 'categories' and 'source id' fields.  
Step 4: The user runs this program against the generated JSON file from step 3, (command line usage: java -jar GA_JSON_InsertRelativeFilePath.jar "inputfilename.json")
Step 5: The user places the resulting JSON file in the parent directory of the aforementioned "Files" directory.  

Outputs to same directory as input file, named "inputfilename_output.json", respectively.  

Links JSON file to MD5 named files located at JSON_file_path\Files\

When importing, do not use local database/GID for categories, which are already present in JSON.
